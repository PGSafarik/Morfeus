## 1. GENERAL INFO:
Under construction

## 2. COMPILATION AND INSTALLATION:
*Dependecies:*
  * [Foxtoolkit 1.7.76](http://fox-toolkit.org/ftp/fox-1.7.76.tar.gz)
  * [FXGHI 0.2.1](https://github.com/PGSafarik/FoxGHI)
  * [TinyXML-2 8.0.0](https://github.com/leethomason/tinyxml2)
  
*Aditional dependencies for compilation:*
  * cmake >= 3.10
  * g++

  
After downloading the project from Github (and possibly unzipping it), go to the folder with the project and enter the following command sequence:
```
  mkdir build
  cd build 
  cmake .. && make
  sudo make install
```
After successfully compiling and building the project, the resulting program, including the Lua language launcher, 
will be installed in the directory /usr/local/bin

Note:
The foxlib library MUST be installed on your system at compile time. Version 1.7 is a development version, so it is possible that you will not have it on your system and it will not be available in the repository, so you will have to install it manually. More information on how to do this can be found on the foxtoolkit website. The following lines refer to any CMakeLists modifications.

If you have the library installed in a location other than the standard one, this fact must be entered in the CMakeLists.txt file in the project directory. Find and change the lines setting the library path:
```
    INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES( "/Cesta/vasi/instalaci/foxlib/include" )   #Foxlib headers
    LINK_DIRECTORIES( "/Cesta/vasi/instalaci/foxlib/lib" )          #Foxlib library
```
These lines are commented out by default, so remove the leading '#' characters after editing, and then save the file. Next, follow the instructions for building and installing the project above as normal.

## 3. KNOWN ERRORS AND BUGS
* 27/09/2022 - No load control file from CMD  - FIXED, CLOSED 30/09/2022  
  When entering (only) the name of the control file from CMD, Morfeus does not load it.  
  RESOLUTION: The error was in checking the name under which Morfeus was run. This led to the program mistakenly thinking it was running over a link.
